This project is to translate the novel - "Ponniyin Selvan" by Kalki Krishnamoorthy into English.
In addition we can even add illustrations and maps to compliment the story.

I have added a copy of the full text in tamil from the [Project Madurai](http://book.ponniyinselvan.in/).
This shall be the reference copy for all the translation work.
