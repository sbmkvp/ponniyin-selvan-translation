We invite our readers to join us in the boat of imagination to travel back in the limitless expanse of time. At the rate of a century per second, lets go back 972 years (written in 1950).

In the southern part of Thirumunaipadi country, between the Thondai country and Chola country, 10 miles west of Thillai-Chitrambalam lies a vast sea like expanse of a lake. Its name is ViraNarayana Lake. It extends 15miles in north south direction and 2.5 miles in the east west direction. The name morphed with time to become "Veraanathhu" lake today. during the aadi - aavani months When the new floods flow in the lake and the lake is filled to the brim, People who see the lake cannot go without feeling pride and impressed by the achievements of their tamil ancestors in their time. Did our ancestors just did things which benefitted them and their people of that time? They did things which benefitted their descendants for millenia later. Didn't they?

On the 18th of aadi, afternoon, a young soldier was riding on his horse on the shore of the vast sea like lake. He belonged to the brave tamil clan of Vaanars. His name was Vallavarayan Vanthiyaththevan. His horse was moving slowly after being tired from a long journey. He did not worry about it. His heart was charmed by the view of the large lake.
